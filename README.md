# Multiple-Disease-Detection
Download the "MultipleDiseasePrediction.csv" dataset from this  GitHub repository.
Examine the README file in this  GitHub repository to understand the structure of the dataset, the meaning of each column, and any preprocessing steps that might be needed.
Use Python and pandas to load the dataset and explore its structure.
Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and preprocess the data as needed based on the information in the README file.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build and Train the KNN Model
